//The <GifSearch /> component will render a form that receives the user input for the Giphy search. The text input should be a controlled component 
// that stores the value of the input in its component state and renders the DOM accordingly. 
// The React component is always in charge of what the DOM looks like.

// GifSearch should receive a callback prop from its parent. On a submit event, it should invoke that callback prop with the value of the text input. 
// It is this callback function, defined in GifListContainer, that will actually query the API with the text the user has entered.
